Sprint Time Tracker
===============================

## Motivation

Our team do daily stand-up meetings and usually spend some minutes capturing time information, but that it isn't an efficient use of time, this simple app was built to encourage this process to be done asynchronously and make it easier than doing from the original Web-Ui.

It is only implemented to support Azure Devops, but it can be extended to support other back ends such as Jira/GitLab/Redmine etc.

## Installing

Get one of the prepared releases.

## Building locally

This project uses Gradle, you can run the app by using:

```bash
./gradlew run
```
